# Pig-game-recreation-with-React
This project is recreation of a simple board game - pig game - using React. The original project was built using vanila Javascript. After I learned the basics of React, I decided to 
recreate this project by applying what I just learned. The game is very simple. It involves two players who will take turn to roll a dice, their round score will keep stacking up accoring 
to the number rolled. When they hit one with the dice or press the Hold button, the turn will be switched to another player who will be performing the process. When a one is rolled, the 
current round score for the playing player will be all gone; when the player hasn't rolled a one and presses the Hold button, all the current round score will be pushed to her total score.
Eventually, the winner will be the one with the higher total score.
